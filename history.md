###Version History


####v0.2.0
- Added subpackage `graphics` to `resources` and moved all graphics resources into it.
- Added audio export in Wave format.
    - Added new command line options (`[-w]` or `[--wav]`) to trigger wave export in command line mode.
    - Modified `Midi.exportAudio()` (former `Midi.exportWav()`) to create and return an instance of `meico.audio.Audio`.
    - Added several methods to class `Audio`. Audio data is now represented in an `AudioInputStream` and can be written into a file.
    - Modified method `meico.midi.Midi2WavRenderer`. Its rendering methods return an `AudioInputStream` object instead of directly writing a file into the file system.
    - Extended the window mode graphical user interface to include the new functionalities.
    - Updated `README.md`.
- Added subpackage `soundfonts` to `resources`.
- Instead of using one global midi sequencer for Midi playback in class `meico.app.MeiCoApp` (window mode) I switched to the built-in local sequencers in class `meico.midi.Midi`.
- Added tooltips in window mode for better user guidance.
- Introduced some layouting variables in class `meico.app.MeiCoApp` for better editing of the window mode graphical user interface via global variables.


####v0.1.4
- Added basic audio export to midi package (`meico.midi.Midi2WavRenderer.java`).
- Added `UnsupportedSoundbankException.java` to package `meico.midi`.
- Added test audio output to command line mode.


####v0.1.3
- Renamed the `element` elements in the MSM format. In the `timeSignatureMap` they are called `timeSignature`, in `keySignatureMap` they are called `keySignature` and in the `markerMap`they are now called `marker`.
- Method `Helper.computePitchOld()` deleted.
- Added method `Mei.processAccid()`, so `accid` elements are now processed not only as children of `note` elements (as until now) but also when they are siblings to `note` elements and the like. However, the attributes `ploc` and `oloc` are required to associate the accidental with a pitch.
- Ids generated by meico (UUIDs) did not validate. This issue is fixed. Generated ids start with `"meico_"`.
- Added support for multiple `body` elements in an MEI `music` element. This is no valid MEI, though, but meico won't crash if it occurs anyway.
- Added processing of `incip`, `parts`, and `part` elements.
- Little bugfix with `halfmRpt`.
- Added method `Helper.pname2midi()` as this functionality is used at several occasions.
- Key signature processing (`scoreDef`, `staffDef`, `keySig`) in method `Mei.makeKeySignature()` has been redone. 
    - More cases and unorthodox/mixed key signatures are now covered, also in the MSM representation. 
    - Nonetheless, `keyAccid` elements require the `pname` attribute so that meico can associate the accidental with a pitch class.
    - If not indicated by `keyAccid` elements, `scoreDef`, `staffDef`, and `keySig` require at least the `key.sig` or `sig` attribute to denote a key signature. 
    - Attribute `key.sig.mixed` or `sig.mixed` are also supported.
    - The octave position of the key signature accidentals is ignored. It is not clearly defined if an accidental affects only this one octave or all octaves of that pitch class. In meico we decided to interpret it in the latter way.
    - Modified method `Helper.computePitch()` to consider key signature accidentals.
- The processing of `chord` elements (`bTrem` and `fTrem` are processed similarly) has been redone. If a `chord` element has no duration data in its attributes (`dur`, `dots`) and does not inherit it from a parent element, its duration is now specified by the longest child element.
- Added `Prinzipal`, `Soprano`, `Baritone`, `Euphonium`, `Chant` to the instruments dictionary.
- Bugfix in `Mei.reorderElements()`, relevant in the case that a `startid` attribute refers to an element within the element.
- Minor corrections in `MeiCoApp.commandLineMode()`.


####v0.1.2
- Bugfix in command line mode: missing path when writing `"-debug.mei"` and the file has been loaded via relative path.
- Added `S.`, `A.`, `T.`, `B.` to the instrument dictionary for ChoirOhs.
- Method `InstrumentsDictionary.getProgramChange()` outputs its string matching results to the command line or log file, resp.
- Missing `accid.ges` attribute processing in `Helper.computePitch()` added.


####v0.1.1
- Renamed the `dur` attribute in MSM notes and rests into `midi.duration`.
- Further renamings: `date` into `midi.date`, `pitch` into `midi.pitch`, `channel.midi` into `midi.channel`, and `port.midi` into `midi.port`.
- Added `Bassus`, `Cantus`, `Singstimme`, `Singstimmen`, `Pianoforte`, `Trumpet in`, `Trompete in` to the instruments dictionary.
- Added a flag to the window mode constructor method `MeiCoApp(String title, boolean makeLogFile)`. The redirection of console output into a log file is done only when `makeLogFile` is set true.
- Bugfixing in `Mei.processStaff()` and `Helper.getPart()`.
- `tie` elements are now processed (new method `Mei.resolveTieElements()`); they are resolved into `tie` attributes of `note` elements during the preprocessing. Hence, meico now supports the use of `tie`elements and is no longer restricted to `tie` attributes only. However, users should not mix `tie` and `slur` elements; the latter are not and will not be processed as ties!
- Method `Mei.resolveCopyOfs()` rewritten. It is not only faster now. It might happen (and does happen in the MEI sample library) that a placeholder element (the one with the `copyof` attribute) copies elements that again contain placeholders; it requires multiple runs to resolve this. The new implementation can handle circular referencing (cannot be resolved and would otherwise lead to infinite loops). Furthermore, if the placeholder element has an `xml:id` this id is no longer overwritten by the newly generated ids.
- Method `Mei.reorderElements()` (part of the MEI preprocessing) has been rewritter and is much faster now.


####v0.1.0 (beta release)<br>
- Moved unused code in the `meico.midi` package into the `legacy` sub-package.
- Added validation of MEI files against `mei-CMN.rng` version 3.0.0 (August 2016).
    - The file `mei-CMN.rng` from [MEI GitHub repository](https://github.com/music-encoding/music-encoding/blob/develop/schemata/mei-CMN.rng) was added to the resources. 
    - The `Jing` library (version 20091111) was added to the externals (notice the `copyright.txt` in file `jing-20091111.jar`).
    - The method `validateAgainstSchema()` is implemented in class `Helper` and called by `validate()` through `readMeiFile()` in class `Mei`. 
    - New addition to command line mode: `[-v]` or `[--validate]`: to activate validation of mei files loaded.
    - In window mode files are read without validation by default. Right click on the MEI file loaded to trigger validation and get a popup message on the success. 
    - Applications may call method `isValid()` in class `Mei` after the file was read to check validity. If the file has been loaded without validation it remains `false` by default. To do the validation afterwards, call `validate()`.
- In window mode all command line outputs (`System.out` and `System.err`) are now redirected into a log file `meico.log`.
- Added `Bratsche` to the instruments dictionary.
- Replaced the `:` in the id generation for copyOf resolution into `_`.


####v0.0.7<br>
- Added flag to the mei-to-msm conversion to avoid the midi drum channel, added it to the window mode and command line options
	- `[-c]` or `[--dont-use-channel-10]`: the flag says whether channel 10 (midi drum channel) shall be used or not; it is already done at mei-to-msm convertion, because the msm should align with the midi file later on
- Changed id generation for copyOf resolution into a combined id: `source id + ":" + generated id`; hence, applications can now trace them back to the source element
- Minor bugfix of command line option `[--no--program-changes]` to `[--no-program-changes]`
- Minor ui corrections for window mode
- Adding new attributes, `date.midi` and `dur.midi`, to mei note and rest elements during conversion. This is only for debugging purpose and appears only in the `-debug.mei` file when running the command line mode with `--debug` flag.
- Also a `pnum` is added to the mei `note` elements in the debug version which holds the calculated midi pitch value.


####v0.0.6<br>
- Added `Canto`, `Quinto` and `Tenore` to the `VoiceOhs` in the instruments dictionary.
- In `MeiCoApp`'s `commandLineMode()` a relative path can be used; the absolute path is derived automatically. Hence, users do not have to write down whole paths in the command line from now on.
- Fixed bug in the processing of note accidentals when `accid` elements are used instead of `accid` attributes.
- Fixed bug in `Helper.getNextSiblingElement(Element ofThis)`.
- Method `exportMidi()` in `Msm.java` now has a flag to suppress the generation of program change events (useful in some applications). The flag is also supported in command line mode (add `[--no-program-changes]` to your call) and window mode (right click on the msm to midi conversion button).
- Added an optional tempo parameter to the command line mode `[-t argument]` or `[--tempo argument]`.
- Changed the format of the command line parameters to follow POSIX standard.
	- `[-?]` or `[--help]`: for this command line help text. If you use this, any other arguments are skipped.
	- `[-a]` or `[--add-ids]`: to add xml:ids to note, rest and chord elements in mei, as far as they do not have an id; meico will output a revised mei file
	- `[-r]` or `[--resolve-copy-ofs]`: mei elements with a `copyOf` attribute are resolved into selfcontained elements with an own `xml:id`; meico will output a revised mei file
	- `[-m]` or `[--msm]`: converts mei to msm; meico will write an msm file to the path of the mei
	- `[-i]` or `[--midi]`: converts mei to msm to midi; meico will output a midi file to the path of the mei
	- `[-p]` or `[--no-program-changes]`: call this to suppress the generation of program change events in midi
	- `[-t argument]` or `[--tempo argument]`: this sets the tempo of the midi file; the argument must be a floating point number; if this is not used the tempo is always 120 bpm
	- `[-d]` or `[--debug]`: to write debug versions of mei and msm
	- Path tho the mei file (e.g., `"D:\Arbeit\Software\Java\MEI Converter\test files\Hummel_Concerto_for_trumpet.mei"`), this should always be the last parameter -  always in quotes!

####v0.0.5<br>
Bugs fixed in `Mei.java` that were introduced by rewriting `convert()` for Java 1.6 compatibility.

####v0.0.4<br>
Java 1.6+ compatibility<br>
instrument dictionary extended (`church organ`: `upper`, `lower`, `pedal`)

####v0.0.3<br>
So far, msm part names were the `staffDef` labels. Now, they are created from an eventually existing parent `staffGrp` label and the `staffDef` label (`"staffGrp label" + " " + "staffDef label"`).

####v0.0.2<br>
Java 7+ compatibility

####v0.0.1<br>
first release (requires Java 8+)
